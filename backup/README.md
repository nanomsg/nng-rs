# nng-rs

This repository contains [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) bindings for the
[NNG](https://github.com/nanomsg/nng) library. Each crate is located in its own
subdirectory and maintained independently.

## `nng`

A safe, idiomatic Rust wrapper for [NNG](https://github.com/nanomsg/nng). It
aims to provide an API that is similar to the original C library, making it easy
to adapt existing examples.  For more details, please see the [`nng` crate's
README](./nng/README.md).
