# ANNG Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating the key messaging
patterns supported by the `anng` library. Some of these examples are
based on the original NNG demos and showcase idiomatic async Rust usage,
while others just showcase how the various protocols work.

Each example includes a doc-comment at the top that explains what it's
for and how to run it.
